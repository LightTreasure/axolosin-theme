## Inspiration
- *Axolotls*: Syntax highlighting in Axolosin is inspired by the beautiful colours of Leucistic Axolotls and their habitats. Bright pinks, violet, orange, marine blue, and sea green are featured prominently. 

- *Rosin*: Besides syntax highlighting, Axolosin also themes the UI of the Zed code editor. Here the emphasis is to use blur, translucency, as well as shades of white and black to imitate the translucency of Rosin, a solid resin obtained from pine. The use of grey, white, and black for UI elements is meant to let the colourfulness of the syntax highlighting shine through.
